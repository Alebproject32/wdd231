        Telecommunication Engineering by Alejandro Pérez, a trainee engineer.
      </h1>
      <p class="intro">
        This is a present of all students who they chosen to be a professional
        Engineering, with this process we understand the creation of God through
        the applying Sciences and I want to offer this website project at my
        future colleagues because I am halfway to getting my degree in
        Telecommunication Engineering and it´s a way to get a landscape about my
        major and one of the future profession.

        <p>
          The history of telecommunications begins with visual signals such as
          smoke signals and optical beacons, evolving to the telegraph,
          telephone, radio, and now modern digital systems.

        <p>
          Telecommunications is an applied science because it combines physics,
          mathematics, and engineering principles to build communication systems
          that shape modern society.

        <p>
          Great minds like Alexander Graham Bell, Guglielmo Marconi, and Claude
          Shannon laid the foundation for the systems we use today. Their
          contributions revolutionized how we connect with each other.
